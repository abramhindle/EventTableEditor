Abram's Table Editor

Version 0.1 -- released

This is meant for editing csound tables.
I have provided a sample score and orchestra which will be compatible with 
the table editor.

To use the table editor one will see a screen with a white panel, a panel with
some text and buttons, then a panel with an add button.

The white panel is the table editing panel, using your mouse you can draw the
values that you want in the table, these values will be between min and max
(you can set min and max). All these values will be associated with an index
in table determined by the start and end values.

+------------------------+-------+-----+
|     |      |     |     |(A)|(B)|     |
|(G)  |      |     |     +---+---+     |
|     |      |     |     |(C)|(D)|     |
|------------------------+---+---+ ADD |
|     |      |     |     |(E)|(F)|     |
|(H)  |      |     |     +---+---+     |
|     |      |     |     |ZER|SET|     |
+------------------------+---+---+-----+

(A) - Instrument Number, this is the table setter instrument number.
(B) - Table Number, indicates which table to change
(C) - Minimum value, what the lowest value is 
(D) - Maximum value, what the highest value is
(E) - Start Value, The starting index
(F) - End Value, The ending index, forinstance if the table was size 256 you
would change this to 256.

If any of items A to F change press the RE/SET button to initialize the widget
to your new settings.

At anytime you may click ZERO to zero the table

(G) Positive values
(H) Negative values

Add Button adds more tables, which is useful.
Basically we send messages when the table is changed to CSOUND through STDIN
. These messages then set values in a table. You can then use these tables for
anything.


Provided is an example waveguide orchestra and score. 
Table 1 is the wave to be oscillated.
Table 2 is the waveguide.
Table 3 is the next wave to be oscillated.
Table 4 is the waveguide for table 3.


So your tables must match the tables in your score.

Note this DOES NOT READ tables, it only sets not gets.

Have fun! You can make some nasty sounds with this baby!

./RUN will run the demo, you need Java 1.4.
